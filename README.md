# Open-AI-GPT2-model-and-data
This file contains AI models, data files, and all source code and tests for the GPT2 language model.


Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) is a large language model by OpenAI and the second in their foundational series of GPT models. GPT-2 was pre-trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. It was partially released in February 2019, followed by full release of the 1.5-billion-parameter model on November 5, 2019.
GPT-2 was created as a "direct scale-up" of GPT-1 with a ten-fold increase in both its parameter count and the size of its training dataset. It is a general-purpose learner and its ability to perform the various tasks was a consequence of its general ability to accurately predict the next item in a sequence, which enabled it to translate texts, answer questions about a topic from a text, summarize passages from a larger text, and generate text output on a level sometimes indistinguishable from that of humans; however, it could become repetitive or nonsensical when generating long passages. It was superseded by the GPT-3 and GPT-4 models, which are no longer open source.
